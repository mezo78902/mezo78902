👋 Hey there! I'm Hamza  

🎓 AI Engineering student at Mansoura University, interested in **Python-based automation, AI-powered workflows, and open-source software**.  

💡 I enjoy building practical systems that combine **Python, APIs, and automation tools (like n8n)** to solve real-world problems, and I’m actively preparing to contribute to open-source projects and apply to **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**.

🧰 Technical Skills

- **Programming:** Python, Java, C
- **Automation & Integration:** n8n, REST APIs, Webhooks
- **AI & Data:** AI Basics (ML, Data Classification), Data Cleaning
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, JavaScript


🚀 Projects

📄 **AI-Driven Invoice Processing Pipeline**  
End-to-end automation system for processing invoices and business documents using Python, LLMs, and n8n.

- Built LLM-powered document analysis pipelines to extract structured JSON data from unstructured invoices.
- Implemented prompt engineering techniques and strict JSON schemas to ensure reliable, machine-readable outputs.
- Automated data validation, transformation, and cleanup to improve data consistency.
- Integrated REST APIs, Google Sheets, and backend data sources (SQL) within automation workflows.
- Orchestrated the full pipeline using n8n, with Python handling core logic and processing.
